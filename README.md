The official version of my Notepad website, a small, but usable, website with dark-theme and light-theme, and a save button.

If you find a bug and *know* how to fix it, create a [pull request](https://github.com/CodingRedpanda/Notepad/pulls) with the new code, and write a description of what you changed.
